[B]Using Marvin XD:[/B]
[LIST]

[B]Tips & Tricks:[/B]
[LIST]
[*]The first time that you use Marvin XD with an iDevice, caches are created which will make subsequent connections much faster.
[*]If you have a very large calibre library, you can speed up initialization by creating a Virtual Library, which will limit the number of books in your calibre library that Marvin XD is analyzing.
[*]Marvin XD has been tested with a library of 4200 books.
